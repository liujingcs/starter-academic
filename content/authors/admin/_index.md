I am a Ph.D. student supervised Asst. Prof. [Bohan Zhuang](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=DFuDBBwAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Jianfei Cai](https://jianfei-cai.github.io/). My research interests include network compression and acceleration. Recently, I have published some papers in ECCV and NeurIPS. I served as the reviewer for several conferences, such as MICCAI and ICPR.
